### Hi there, I'm Izaac ðŸ‘‹

I am currently studying Analysis and Systems Development (3rd semester) at Universidade da AmazÃ´nia (UNAMA). As an enthusiast of Java programming language I am always searching for ways to deepen my knowledge about it and its related technologies, I am looking forward to collaborate on the development of back-end projects.

Feel free to connect with me on my [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/izaac-rego-cardoso) or [e-mail](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?tab=rm&ogbl#inbox).
